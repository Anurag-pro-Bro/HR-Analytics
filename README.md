# HR-Analytics
Human resources are vital to the success of any organization. Companies invest significant time and money in hiring and developing their employees, making it costly when employees, especially key ones, leave. If HR departments could predict which employees are likely to resign, they could proactively address the risks of attrition. This would enable them to offer necessary support to retain valuable employees or engage in preventative hiring, reducing the potential negative impact on the organization.

The dataset includes the following fields:

Employee satisfaction level
Last evaluation score
Number of projects worked on
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
History of workplace accidents
